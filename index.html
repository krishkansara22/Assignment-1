            <h2>Biography</h2>
            <p>Nikola Tesla, born in 1856 in Smiljan, Austrian Empire (now Croatia), was a Serbian-American inventor and engineer who revolutionized the field of electrical engineering. Tesla's father was an Orthodox priest, and his mother was an inventor of household appliances. Tesla studied at the Realschule, Karlstadt in 1873, the Polytechnic Institute in Graz, Austria, and the University of Prague.</p>
            <p>1884, Tesla moved to the United States and started working with Thomas Edison, which began a famous rivalry. Tesla developed the alternating current (AC) electrical system, which was more efficient than Edison's direct current (DC) electrical system. He sold his AC patents to George Westinghouse, an American entrepreneur and engineer.</p>
            <p>Tesla's most significant contribution was the development of the modern alternating current (AC) electricity supply system. He also invented the Tesla coil, used in radio technology. Despite his profound contributions, Tesla struggled financially and lived in various hotels in New York City, where he died in 1943.</p>
            <p>Tesla's work continues to inspire scientists and inventors worldwide. His life and inventions signify the power of innovation and the importance of resilience in the face of challenges.</p>
